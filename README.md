I no longer want to set up Macs manually. They became unreliable and soulless since 2011. It was a sad year...

I want to be up and running on any Mac within minutes, with a single command. There will be no language dependencies, just the standard shell.

I will never restore from TimeMachine or other fancy backup systems. I just don't trust anything other than rsync & ZFS.
