I no longer want to set up Macs manually. They became unreliable and soulless since 2011. It was a sad year...

I want to be up and running on any Mac within minutes, with a single command. There will be no language dependencies, just the standard shell.

I will never restore from TimeMachine or other fancy backup systems. I just don't trust anything other than rsync & ZFS.

This won't set up any apps coming through the App Store. If there is a command line utility for the App Store, let me know, not doing it otherwise.

Apps coming from brew cask will still need to be configured. This will remain a manual process as I do not want to maintain the different configuration formats & licensing setups. 80% is good enough.
